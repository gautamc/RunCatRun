======= RunCatRun -- A quick Catalyst web application for fun ======

 * Because writing perl code is fun ;-)

 1) Run script/runcatrun_server.pl to test the application.
 2) This application is built using the catalyst perl MVC framework (Catalyst is similar to RoR, but written in Perl)
 3) The app has one controller and one model. The Controller allows users to search for videos based on on tags/categories
 4) The model:  lib/RunCatRun/Model/YouTube.pm, implements the interaction with the youtube api
 5) The app uses prototype.js for the single ajaxed search form.

 * Requirements:
   Perl 5, CPAN, Catalyst framework (http://www.catalystframework.org)
   Essentially, the command show run without complaining:
   $ cpan Catalyst::Helper::Graphics Catalyst LWP::UserAgent XML::XPath XML::XPath::XMLParser
